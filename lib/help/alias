Syntax: alias <alias> <thing for alias to do>
        clear <alias #> will clear the alias for you.

Aliases allow you to carry out a complex command with few keystrokes.
The <h> alias system can hold an unlimited number of aliases, each up
to 999 characters in length.

eg.:	alias cl cast cure light
	After setting this alias up, you could type:
	cl JoeBlow, and cure him instead of typing the whole spell out.

You can stack commands with aliases, using ~ as separator, like this:
	alias hme pray heal self~continue

To add parameters to stacked commands, use %:
	alias h pray heal %~cont~comf %

To view your present aliases, type ALIAS with no parameters.
